# stock-price-predictor-tensorflow
This is an stock price prediction using TensorFlow and Python Libraries
<br>
The model leverages historical stock price data and deep learning techniques to forecast future stock prices.

**Project** **Description** <br>
Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the finance industry. This project aims to create a model that can predict stock prices using historical data. Weâ€™ll use TensorFlow and Keras for building a deep learning model that predicts the future stock price based on past trends.<br>

**Key** **Features**:<br>
1. Data Preprocessing: Importing, cleaning, and normalizing the stock price data.<br>
2. LSTM Model: Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model sequential data.<br>
3. Evaluation Metrics: Model performance evaluation using metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).<br>
4. Visualization: Plots showing predicted vs actual stock prices.<br>
<br>
Dataset: <br>
This model uses historical stock price data, typically including:<br>
Date,
Open price,
Close price,
High and Low prices,
Volume of stocks traded.
